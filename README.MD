<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project


The application was built as a supplementary project for Shopify's Front End Internship. The primary goal of this project is to render images from any one of NASA's Public APIs. For my take on this, I wanted the end-user interface should be simple and not overly complex while providing fast, accurate results and appropriate error handling. 

As per the challenge, there were some baseline requirements:

* Fetch data from one of NASA's APIs and display the resulting images 
* Display descriptive data for each image (for example: title, date, description, etc.)
* Like an image
* Unlike an image

I wanted to put my personal touch on this and decided to provide a little more capabilities for the user.

* Choose a specific date and return NASA's Picture of The Day for the specified date
* Ensure proper error handling is implemented and allow users to search again
* Animate the like button 
* Display a thumbnail if the "Picture of the Day" is a video

### Built With

Here are some of the key technologies and frameworks I used to build this application

* [Node.js](https://nextjs.org/)
* [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/)
* [EJS](https://ejs.co/)
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com)
* [JQuery](https://jquery.com)


<b>Express.js and Node.js</b> were utilized for GET/POST requests as well as route handling</br> 
<b>EJS</b> was utilizes to inject required data into the front-end</br> 
<b>Bootstrap</b> was the main framework used to design the front end </br> 
<b>jQuery</b> used to animate the like button

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Challenges

Along the way, there were several obstacles in developing this application.

* Ensuring a picture gets returned regardless of the media type being returned
* Route handling to ensure no dead-ends experienced by end user
* Hide sensitive information (ie API Key)
